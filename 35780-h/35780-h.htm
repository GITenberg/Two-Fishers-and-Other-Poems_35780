<tr><td>When the War is over, Charley,<br />
We'll go fishing once again.<br />
You'll be a new man, Charley,<br />
When you walk with fishermen.<br />
For we'll seek a leaping river<br />
I know far among the fells;<br />
You'll forget the War there, Charley,<br />
Where the springing water wells.<br />
<br />
It's God's own land for the nimble trout,<br />
And ferns and waving flowers,<br />
The bracken and the bilberry,<br />
And the ash the coral dowers.<br />
There are rolling leagues of heather,<br/>
Lone hills where the plovers call.<br/>
Oh, we'll climb those hills together<br/>
Ere the last dews fall!<br/>
<br />
And we'll talk to the wild creatures<br/>
In the crannies of the moors;<br/>
Oh, our hearts will mount to Heaven<br/>
When the merry lark soars!<br/>
All our days will shine with gladness,<br/>
All our nights with calm repose.<br/>
And we'll throw a fly together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><br/>
Where the rushing stream flows.<br/>
<br />
Nature has been to me lately<br/>
As a fair and radiant bride,<br/>
She has drawn me with strange gentleness<br/>
To the hollow of her side.<br/>
She has gone forth like a warrior<br/>
With pricking glaive and spear,<br/>
And Grief has quailed in his ambush<br/>
When her flashing arms drew near.<br/>
<br />
I never loved sweet England<br/>
Till she kissed me in the West,<br/>
The sun upon her shining brows<br/>
And the purple on her breast,<br/>
Breathing songs of low compassion<br/>
To my spirit as it cried,<br/>
When I mourned that sinning country<br/>
Which had thrust me from her side.<br/>
<br />
All the wooded hills of the Eifel,<br/>
All the vine-bergs of the Rhine,<br/>
All the glimmering strands of the Baltic,<br/>
All the Brocken black with pine,<br/>
Hold no tenderness of Beauty,<br/>
(Beauty in the spirit dwells,)<br/>
Such as smiles from one sweet valley<br/>
Darkling 'mid the Western fells.<br/>

<br/>
Do you remember, old fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span><br/>
When we fished near Altenahr,<br/>
Where the red wine was flowing<br/>
And the bowl flashed a star?<br/>
Do you remember the big schutzmann,<br/>
With his sword by his side,<br/>
Who guessed that you were poaching,<br/>
And scared you off to hide?<br/>
<br />
Oh, if he'd only known, Charley,<br/>
When you sought the bridge's cover<br/>
That you'd join the British Army<br/>
And go killing of his brother,<br/>
He'd have searched bank and vineyard<br/>
For a poacher of such worth,<br/>
And put you in a prison cell<br/>
To cool your summer's mirth.<br/>
<br />
And do you remember the old inn<br/>
With the blue saint above the door,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;<br/>
Simon Peter, who looked longingly<br/>
Upon our speckled store?&mdash;<br/>
He who loves all careless fishers<br/>
Of the river and the sea,<br/>
And prays that God shall save them<br/>
With his mates of Galilee.<br/>
<br />
And what a wild night we had<br/>
When we rode home again!<br/>
For the students were all dancing<br/>
And singing in the train;<br/>
And a tall man twanged a banjo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><br/>
Till he fairly gave us fits;<br/>
And a porter ran up swearing,<br/>
And the banjo flew to bits.<br/>
<br />
We were all drunk as blazes,<br/>
Full of wine to burst.<br/>
But, by the sober lads of England,<br/>
Those Germans were the worst.<br/>
They were singing and dancing,<br/>
And shouting with delight;<br/>
And the carriage rocked with laughter<br/>
As we rushed into the night.<br/>
<br />
They are all dead now, Charley;<br/>
They were merry fellows then.<br/>
They are dust and scattered ashes<br/>
Washed by the rain.<br/>
They are crying in the darkness<br/>
Where a grayer planet spins.<br/>
But the Lord is kind to fishers<br/>
And has spared us in our sins.<br/>
<br />
Oh, the Lord is kind to fishers<br/>
Of the river and the sea<br/>
For the sake of Simon Peter<br/>
And the lads of Galilee!<br/>
For the sake of Simon Peter,<br/>
Who so gladly would us shrive,<br/>
We are walking in the sunlight,<br/>
We are breathing and alive.<br/>
<br/>
And when the War is over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><br/>
We'll fish awhile together,<br/>
We'll climb the Western mountains,<br/>
And walk the Western heather,<br/>
And the curlew and the wild grouse<br/>
Will wake the vales with crying,<br/>
And their soft rushing pinions<br/>
Will tremble by us, sighing.<br/>
<br />
All the dead shepherds<br/>
Will hear them in their rest.<br/>
But you mustn't heed dead shepherds<br/>
When you're fishing in the West;<br/>
You mustn't heed the lonely men<br/>
Who neither sing nor dance,<br/>
There'll be always ghosts there, Charley,<br/>
When the wind beats up from France.<br/>
<br />
It's the holy peace and quiet<br/>
Breathing from the Western skies<br/>
Which bring the stricken soul its rest<br/>
And still the heart's wild cries.<br/>
If I hadn't turned for healing<br/>
Where the moor to Heaven swells,<br/>
I'd have been a dead man, listening<br/>
To the mourning of the bells.<br/>
<br />
If God hadn't sent me healing<br/>
Where the mountain bares her breast,<br/>
I'd have gone wild and crazy<br/>
With the things that I'm oppressed.<br/>
All my mad, merry comrades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><br/>
Of drink, and fight, and lust,<br/>
Are trodden into bloody clay<br/>
And blowing with the dust.<br/>
<br />
Some marched away with Hindenburg,<br/>
And some with General Kluck,<br/>
One under Austria's banners<br/>
With the devil's cards for luck.<br/>
All my dreams went with them,<br/>
All the dreams my land denied;<br/>
But they're smoke and drifting wreckage now<br/>
On the War's wild tide.<br/>
<br />
It was years since I left England,&mdash;<br/>
Almost singing to depart,&mdash;<br/>
She had cast a net about me,<br/>
And thrust a dagger in my heart.<br/>
But another country smiled to me<br/>
And made me quiet nooks,<br/>
Where men crushed for me the grapes of joy,<br/>
And talked to me of books.<br/>
<br />
She was a kind land to me once, Charley,<br/>
I had real joy in her once;<br/>
Her folk loved Shakespeare and Byron,<br/>
Shunned no dreamer for a dunce.<br/>
They sang old folk songs, noble opera;<br/>
Read Anglo-Saxon, old quaint sweets;<br/>
And there were no starved souls in her temples,<br/>
And no begging men in her streets.<br/>
<br/>
But a hand ever cut my Heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><br/>
With the sharpness of a sword,<br/>
There was the very riot of gladness,<br/>
Reckless squander of Joy's hoard;<br/>
Lechery and sad Corruption<br/>
Danced in clinging robes of Light;<br/>
Beauty smiled in the arms of Terror<br/>
And diced with the minions of Night.<br/>
<br />
And you sprang to England's banner, comrade,<br/>
With glad praises on your lips,<br/>
To the song of her sabres ringing<br/>
And the thunder of her ships.<br/>
But a sword broods in the darkness<br/>
Whose sweep is the wind's sway,<br/>
And the dumb white ships of Heaven<br/>
Bear dimly Earth's glory away.<br/>
<br />
The still white ships of Heaven<br/>
Steal out beneath the stars;<br/>
And the grieving, sorrowing sailors<br/>
Are the dead men of the wars.<br/>
They reck not of the chilly seas<br/>
That wildly round them churn.<br/>
And the dusk scatters before the prows,<br/>
And the leaping waters burn.<br/>
<br />
The pirate fleets of Heaven<br/>
Sweep forth into the night,<br/>
Laden with spoils of the living,<br/>
Their jewels of delight,<br/>
Their topazes and rubies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span><br/>
The bawds that gave them pleasure;<br/>
And the sad thieves reef the swelling sails,<br/>
And steal from Earth her treasure.<br/>
<br />
And the night hangs heavy on you, comrade,<br/>
And the bitter War goes on.<br/>
You are parched for Heaven's starlight<br/>
And her soft, refreshing sun.<br/>
Joy runs with a passion of swiftness<br/>
On the gray feet of the wind.<br/>
The doors of darkness tremble;<br/>
Then swing back blind.<br/>
<br />
But you'll be a new man, one day,<br/>
Where the west wind thrills.<br/>
You'll walk with your olden vigour<br/>
Where Heaven clasps the great lone hills.<br/>
And the evening sun will squander<br/>
Soft lustre of red wine,<br/>
And we'll drink the ripest vintage<br/>
Where the sun and stars shine.<br/>
<br />
For the Lord is kind to fishers<br/>
Of the river and the sea,<br/>
For the sake of Simon Peter<br/>
And the lads of Galilee;<br/>
For the sake of Simon Peter,<br/>
Who so lightly would us shrive,<br/>
We will drink the wine of Heaven<br/>
And give praise we are alive.<br/>
<br />
All our days will shine with gladness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><br/>
All our nights with rich repose;<br/>
Laughter will breathe from our spirits<br/>
Like the sweet scent from the rose.<br/>
And Joy in glittering armour<br/>
Will go forth as with a sword,<br/>
When we climb the fells together<br/>
To the glory of the Lord.<br/>
<br />
Sweet sounds will rise from the moorland,<br/>
And bird and bee awake.<br/>
Beauty will break and blossom<br/>
For each stricken soldier's sake.<br/>
Oh, your heart will leap with joy, Charley,<br/>
And your spirit know rest,<br/>
When we fish a little river<br/>
I've heard singing in the West!<br/></td></tr></table>

At the stairway's end.<br/>

Villainous fellows for War's regalia.<br/>

The very cannon of its rage!<br/>
<br />
My neighbour plays a violin,<br/>
Shredding sweet silver down the din<br/>
And songs for fears to dwindle in.<br/>
<br />
But the houses shake; and the dogs wake.<br/>
They growl, they bark for warrior joy,<br/>
And seek the airmen to annoy.<br/>
<br />
Up go their tails into the air,<br/>
They gnash their teeth, and their eyes glare.<br/>
But on those cruel raiders sail,<br/>
Regardless of each quivering tail.<br/>
<br />
And one gun has a booming note,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><br/>
Another has a cold in throat;<br/>
And some are mellow, and some hoarse,<br/>
And some sound sobbing with remorse;<br/>
Quite four or five ring musical,<br/>
And others very keen to kill.<br/>
<br />
You'd say that twenty champagne corks<br/>
Were popping in the London walks.<br/>
You'd say that drunken men in scores<br/>
Were smashing glass and slamming doors.<br/>
You'd say a twanging banjo string<br/>
Had snapped in twain with hammering.<br/>
You'd say that wild orchestral fellows<br/>
Were banging God's Throne with their cellos.<br/>
A wail, a crash, like steel trays falling,<br/>
And a wind upon the Common&mdash;calling.<br/>
<br />
And over us a sound of humming<br/>
&mdash;Of hornets or bad bees a-bumming!<br/>
A devilish, strident, hoarse, discordant<br/>
Whirring of dark fliers mordant.<br/>
My soul stands still and sweats with fear.<br/>
<br />
But the Heavenly stars, all shimmering,<br/>
Dance in a giddy whirl and sing.<br/>
And other stars, of the Earth, shake sheer<br/>
From the mouths of the black guns thundering.<br/>
<br />
'Tis like some ruining harmony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><br/>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
